### This is a simple weather application using HTML, CSS, and JS.Link to my website [Click here](https://abishekjames.github.io/Weather-Application-using-HTML-CSS-and-Javascript/).API key is required to work this weather app.

**Create three Files: HTML, CSS & JavaScript File.** After creating these files just write the codes to your file.Remember,for Java script you have to pass your API key in the API URL otherwise this weather app won’t work and it returns “something went wrong” error. You can get this key from the official OpenWeatherMap site for free.
You need API Key to run this Project.So after getting your API Key then pass your API key in the API URL of your Java script file.

**How do you get API key for weather app?**

Once you sign up using your email, the API key (APPID) will be sent to you in a confirmation email. Your API keys can always be found on your account page, where you can also generate additional API keys if needed.

**Steps to create API Key:**
* Step 1 – API key info – Go to google search [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API, click on 1st link and make your account here and sign up. After signing up, you see the home page.
* Step 2 –After signing up on this openweather API website whatever you see on the home page because sometimes you get an API key on the home page and some time in the API section so click on API ( In their menu you can see in API) so click on API.
* Step 3 – After clicking on the API form menu, you can see there are lots of APIs but on the API Main page starting you can select (Current weather data) and below there is a box( API information box). So click on API Doc.
